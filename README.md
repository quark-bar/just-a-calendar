# Just a Calendar.

This is a small app that'll generate and show a simple Calendar in the browser. Why?

1. When I want to look at a Calendar, there's not a small light app that just shows me a Calendar, without a 100-odd *engagement* features.
1. When sharing screen, or planning dates with my wife, I want to be able to just put a mark on a date or two, without having to login and stuff.

## Roadmap

Not much. I consider this almost a _finished_ software, and don't currently intend to add large and complicated features. But if it's small QoL improvements, or bugs, or even new related tools, they will be taken up when I find some bandwidth.

So, if you have any suggestions or bugs you faced, please [let me know](https://github.com/sharat87/just-a-calendar/issues/new/choose). Thanks!
